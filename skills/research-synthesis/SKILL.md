# Skill: Research Synthesis

Turn multiple sources into one coherent, actionable analysis.

## When to Use
- Researching a topic with 5+ sources
- Comparing solutions/products/approaches
- Building a brief or recommendation
- Making a decision with complex tradeoffs

## The Process

### Phase 1: Gather (Wide Net)

**Collect sources without judging yet:**
- Articles, papers, docs
- Forum posts, Reddit threads
- Product pages, comparisons
- Expert opinions, tutorials

**For each source, capture:**
- URL/reference
- 2-3 sentence summary
- Key claims or data points
- Credibility signal (official docs, random blog, etc.)

```markdown
## Source: [Title](url)
**Type:** Official docs | Blog | Forum | Paper
**Summary:** What this source says in 2-3 sentences.
**Key points:**
- Point 1
- Point 2
**Credibility:** High/Medium/Low (why)
```

### Phase 2: Organize (Find Patterns)

**Group by theme, not by source:**

Instead of:
- Source A says X, Y, Z
- Source B says X, W

Do this:
- **Topic X:** Source A and B agree...
- **Topic Y:** Only Source A mentions...
- **Topic W:** Source B claims, but contradicts...

**Look for:**
- **Consensus** — What do multiple sources agree on?
- **Conflicts** — Where do sources disagree?
- **Gaps** — What's missing from all sources?
- **Outliers** — Unique insights only one source has

### Phase 3: Analyze (Form Opinions)

Don't just summarize—interpret:

```markdown
❌ "Source A says X. Source B says Y."

✅ "X is well-established (3 sources agree). Y is controversial—
   Source B claims it, but Sources A and C contradict with evidence. 
   I lean toward X because..."
```

**Ask:**
- What's the strongest evidence?
- What's my confidence level?
- What would change my mind?
- What's still uncertain?

### Phase 4: Synthesize (Create Output)

**Structure for decisions:**
```markdown
## Question
[The thing we're trying to figure out]

## TL;DR
[One paragraph answer with recommendation]

## Key Findings
1. [Finding 1 with evidence]
2. [Finding 2 with evidence]
3. [Finding 3 with evidence]

## Tradeoffs
| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| A | ... | ... |
| B | ... | ... |

## Recommendation
[What to do and why]

## Confidence
[High/Medium/Low] — [Why this confidence level]

## Open Questions
- [What we still don't know]

## Sources
- [Source 1]
- [Source 2]
```

## Synthesis Techniques

### The Convergence Test
If 3+ independent sources say the same thing, weight it heavily.
If only 1 source claims something, be skeptical.

### The Recency Check
Is this info current? Tech moves fast.
- Docs dated 2+ years ago? Verify still accurate.
- Tutorial from before major version? Probably outdated.

### The Incentive Filter
Who benefits from this claim?
- Vendor says their product is best? Grain of salt.
- Competitor criticism? Check for bias.
- User complaint? More credible than marketing.

### The "So What" Test
For each finding, ask: "So what? What does this mean for our decision?"
If you can't answer, the finding might not matter.

## Common Pitfalls

### Synthesis vs Summary
- **Summary:** "Source A says X, Source B says Y"
- **Synthesis:** "X is likely true because... despite B's claim that Y"

Synthesis has a point of view. Summary is just repetition.

### Confirmation Bias
You found what you expected. Did you look for contradicting evidence?
Actively seek sources that disagree with your hypothesis.

### Over-Weighting Recent Sources
The last thing you read feels most true. 
Step back and weigh all sources equally.

### Analysis Paralysis
You can always find more sources. Set a limit.
"I'll look at 10 sources max, then decide."

## Output Templates

### Quick Brief (1 page)
```markdown
# [Topic] Brief

**Question:** [What we're answering]

**Answer:** [1-2 sentences]

**Evidence:**
1. [Key point + source]
2. [Key point + source]
3. [Key point + source]

**Caveats:** [What could be wrong]

**Next steps:** [What to do with this info]
```

### Deep Dive (Full Report)
```markdown
# [Topic] Research Report

## Executive Summary
[Full answer in one paragraph]

## Background
[Context needed to understand the question]

## Methodology
[How research was conducted, sources used]

## Findings
### Finding 1: [Title]
[Details, evidence, analysis]

### Finding 2: [Title]
[Details, evidence, analysis]

## Analysis
[Interpretation, patterns, implications]

## Recommendations
[What to do based on findings]

## Appendix
[Raw notes, source list, data]
```

## Output

Research should end with:
1. A clear answer or recommendation
2. Confidence level with justification
3. Key evidence summarized
4. Acknowledgment of what's uncertain
