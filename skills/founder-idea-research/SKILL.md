# Founder Idea Research Toolkit

A multi-source approach to finding validated business ideas for solo founders.

## When to Use

- Morning brief founder idea section
- Deep-dive on a specific niche
- Validating a concept across sources
- Spotting emerging opportunities

---

## 🔴 Reddit

**Why it works:** Raw, unfiltered complaints. People vent in detail. Long posts = deep pain.

### High-Signal Subreddits

| Subreddit | Signal Type |
|-----------|-------------|
| r/SaaS | Direct pain points, case studies, what's working |
| r/Entrepreneur | Scaling problems, tool gaps, workflow frustrations |
| r/startups | Early-stage validation signals |
| r/smallbusiness | Non-tech business owner frustrations |
| r/SideProject | What solos are building, market gaps |
| r/ADHD | Most detailed feature requests (current tools fail them) |
| r/personalfinance | High willingness to pay, specific tool needs |
| r/ecommerce | Shopify/Amazon seller tool gaps |
| r/freelance | Service business pain points |

### Search Queries
```
"I wish there was" OR "someone should build" OR "I'd pay for"
"frustrated with" OR "hate using" OR "why is there no"
"switched from" OR "looking for alternative to"
```

### Key Metrics
- **Willingness to Pay:** Look for "buy", "pay", "premium", "subscription"
- **Frustration Score:** Longer posts = deeper pain = better opportunity
- **Recency:** Sort by "new" for fresh problems, "top" for validated ones

---

## 🐦 Twitter/X

**Why it works:** Indie hackers share real revenue numbers, failures, and what's actually working. Fast signal on trends.

### Accounts to Watch
- Indie hackers sharing build-in-public journeys
- Founders posting revenue screenshots
- People complaining about tools they use daily
- VCs discussing what they're seeing

### Search Queries
```
"I'd pay for" min_faves:50
"why is there no" min_faves:20
"just cancelled" [tool name] — churn signals
"switched from X to Y because" — feature gaps
"building in public" + [niche]
```

### What to Look For
- Products hitting milestones (validates market)
- Complaints about established tools (opportunity gaps)
- Threads about "what I wish existed"
- Failed products (what went wrong = lessons)

---

## 🟠 Hacker News

**Why it works:** Technical audience with money. Devs complaining = devs willing to pay. High-signal comments.

### Where to Look
- **Show HN:** What people are building, comment feedback
- **Ask HN:** Direct "what tools do you wish existed?" threads
- **Comments on launches:** Real critiques, feature requests
- **"Who is hiring" threads:** What tech is in demand

### Search (via hn.algolia.com)
```
"I wish" OR "someone should build"
"looking for" + [tool type]
"alternative to" + [established tool]
"frustrated with" + [category]
```

### High-Value Patterns
- Developer tools always have budget
- DevOps/infrastructure pain = recurring revenue
- Security/compliance = enterprise pricing
- "I built this for myself" stories

---

## 🚀 Product Hunt

**Why it works:** See what's launching, but more importantly, read the comments for what's missing.

### How to Use
1. Browse daily launches in your niche
2. Read comments — look for "I wish it also did X"
3. Check similar products — what are people asking for?
4. Look at "dead" products — why did they fail?

### Signals
- Products with lots of comments but unclear value prop = opportunity to do it better
- Repeated requests in comments = unmet need
- "I've been looking for this!" = validated demand
- Complaints about pricing = room for simpler/cheaper version

---

## 📰 Industry News & Signals

**Why it works:** External changes create opportunities. New APIs, regulations, platform shifts.

### What to Watch
- **New APIs:** Stripe, Plaid, OpenAI releases = new product categories
- **Regulatory changes:** GDPR, accessibility laws = compliance tools
- **Platform shifts:** App Store policy changes, social media algorithm updates
- **Company news:** Big player shutting down a feature = opportunity
- **Pricing changes:** Tool raises prices significantly = cheaper alternative opportunity

### Sources
- TechCrunch, The Verge (mainstream)
- Changelog, Dev.to (developer-focused)
- Industry newsletters in specific verticals
- Company blogs and changelogs

---

## 👀 Personal Observation

**Why it works:** You experience problems firsthand. No research bias.

### Patterns to Notice
- **Friction you hit:** What annoyed you today? This week?
- **Workarounds you built:** Spreadsheets, scripts, manual processes
- **Things you Googled:** "How to X" with no good answer
- **Money you spent:** What did you pay for reluctantly?
- **Time you wasted:** Repetitive tasks that could be automated

### Questions to Ask
- Would I pay $10/mo to not deal with this?
- Is this just me or do others have this problem?
- Why hasn't someone solved this already?
- What's the simplest possible solution?

---

## 🔀 Cross-Referencing (The Gold)

The best ideas show up in **multiple places**:

1. **Reddit complaint** + **Twitter rant** + **no good Product Hunt solution** = validated gap
2. **HN technical discussion** + **new API release** + **existing tools are clunky** = timing opportunity  
3. **Personal frustration** + **Reddit thread with 500 upvotes** = you're not alone

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] **Check our existing ideas first** — Search Linear (TUN/TEN) and ideas.tunajam.com
- [ ] **Check if already solved** — Is there a dominant existing solution? If so, what's our angle?
- [ ] Problem appears in 2+ sources
- [ ] Recent posts (last 3-6 months)
- [ ] People expressing willingness to pay
- [ ] No dominant solution OR existing solutions have clear gaps
- [ ] Buildable by solo founder in weeks, not years

## Tips

1. **Read the comments** — The post might be generic, but replies contain gold
2. **Look for failed products** — "Why did X shut down?" reveals demand + execution gaps
3. **Cross-reference complaints** — Same pain in 3+ places = real problem
4. **"I switched from X to Y because..."** — Reveals feature gaps in existing tools
5. **Time-box research** — 15-30 min max, then synthesize. Don't rabbit-hole.
